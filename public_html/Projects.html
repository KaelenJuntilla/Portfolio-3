                eat your food which is the squares you start to grow bigger and

                <p>Mario is a 2D side scroller game that is a skimp down version
                of the better and awesome Mario game.At the start you go through
                a door which then teleports you to another level that has 2
                enemies.Between those two enemies is a mushroom.If you collect
                it you will grow larger and have a double life.This means if
                you were to be hit by the enemy, you wouldn't die you shrink to
                your normal height and still be alive.The technologies that were used to create
                this game are Html, and Css.For more information on these
                technologies, see my "Technologies Page"</p>
